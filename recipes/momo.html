        <li>50 gm of Finely chopped coriander</li>
        <li>5 finley chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon of Salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Garam Masala</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon of Mustard Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of Turmeric</li>
        <li>Two tablespoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>Two tablespoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>chilli powder as per taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon of momo masala(optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon of sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a suitable bowl, combine the flour and room-temperature water to make the wrapper. Continue adding water as you knead the dough until it is firm and elastic. Give it a cover and 30 minutes to rest.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, combine the minced meat, grated onions, coriander, garlic, ginger, oil, and the remaining spices for the stuffings. Then let it rest for few minutes.</li>
        <li>Take a small amount of the dough and roll it into a ball to create the wrappers. Place the dough out onto a flat surface and roll the dough out to a thin layer. The dough should then be sliced into a circle by placing a circular glass over it. Repeat the process for the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Take a tablespoon of the filling and gently arrange it in the center of the wrapper after cutting it. Using your right thumb and index finger, begin pinching the corners of the wrapper together while holding it in your left hand. Continue until the filling is concealed by the wrapper. Repeat it for the remaining wrapper and stuffings.</li>
        <li>Now we will be using a steamer. The steamer should partially filled with water. Brush some oil over the surface of the steamer and place the Momo's over to the steamer. The steamer should be tightly covered and let it steam for 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>For the dipping, sesame seeds should be taken and fried in a pan until they turn brown. HeatÂ little oil to the pan and fry the diced tomatoes. Add salt, chili flakes, minced ginger and garlic, and turmeric powder. Prepare the mixture until it becomes mushy. Then leave it to cool for a short while.
        <li>The mixture should then be added to a combination with 1/2 glass of water into a blender. Blend it until it is sufficiently thick and smooth for your taste.</li>
        <li>Wholla, your momo and sauce dip has been made.Enjoy your Momos!</li>
